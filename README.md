## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew tap regent-vcs/tap
brew install regent

# Or via Go
go install github.com/regent-vcs/regent/cmd/rgt@latest

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
rgt init

# Work with Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode normally — activity is tracked automatically

# See what happened
rgt log
rgt blame src/file.go:42
rgt show <step-hash>
```

That's it. Your agent activity is now auditable.

## Demo

  <p><em>Every agent turn is automatically captured. No manual commits needed.</em></p>

## Examples

- [Debugging a Bad Refactor](examples/bad-refactor/) - trace a realistic billing regression with `rgt log`, `rgt blame`, and `rgt show`.

---

## What You Get

### See what your agent actually did

```bash
$ rgt log

Step a1b2c3d  |  2 min ago  |  Tool: Edit
│ File: src/handler.go
│ Added error handling to request handler
│ + 5 lines, - 2 lines

Step d4e5f6g  |  5 min ago  |  Tool: Write
│ File: tests/handler_test.go
│ Created unit tests for handler
│ + 23 lines

Step f8g9h0i  |  8 min ago  |  Tool: Bash
│ Command: go mod tidy
│ Cleaned up dependencies
```

### Blame: which prompt wrote this line?

```bash
$ rgt blame src/handler.go:42

Line 42: func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

Step:    a1b2c3d4e5f6
Session: claude-20260502-143021
Tool:    Edit
Prompt:  "Add error handling to the request handler"
```

### Track multiple concurrent sessions

```bash
$ rgt sessions

Active Sessions:
claude_code:claude-20260502-143021  |  3 steps  |  Last: 2 min ago
codex_cli:codex-20260502-091534     |  7 steps  |  Last: 2 hours ago

$ rgt log --session claude_code:claude-20260502-143021
# Filter history by session
```

### See full context for any change

```bash
$ rgt show a1b2c3d

Step a1b2c3d4e5f6
Parent: d4e5f6g7h8i9
Session: claude-20260502-143021
Time: 2026-05-02 14:30:21

Tool: Edit
File: src/handler.go

Changes:
+ func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
+     if r.Method != "GET" {
+         http.Error(w, "Method not allowed", 405)
+         return
+     }
- func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

Conversation:
User: "Add error handling to reject non-GET requests"
Assistant: "I'll add method validation to the handler..."
```

## Why This Exists

AI agents have no version control of their own.

You know this pain:
- *"It was working five minutes ago"*
- *"Why did you change that file?"*
- *"Go back to before the refactor"*
- `/compact` and pray
- Copy-pasting code into a fresh chat

Three primitives that should already exist:

- **`rgt log`** — what did this session do?
- **`rgt blame`** — which prompt wrote this line?
- **`rgt show`** — inspect the full context for any step

We gave agents write access to our codebases. We did not give ourselves git for it. re_gent fixes that.

---

## How It Works

re_gent stores agent activity in `.regent/` (like `.git/`):

```
.regent/
├── objects/     # Content-addressed blobs (BLAKE3)
├── refs/        # Session pointers (one per agent)
├── index.db     # SQLite query index
└── config.toml
```

Every tool-using turn creates a **Step** — a content-addressed snapshot of what changed, why, and who asked:

```go
Step {
  parent:      <previous-step-hash>
  tree:        <workspace-snapshot>
  causes:      [{ tool_name: "Edit", args: <input>, result: <output> }]
  session_id:  "claude_code:claude-20260502-143021"
  timestamp:   "2026-05-02T14:30:21Z"
}
```

Steps form a **DAG**. Each session has its own branch. Common ancestors dedupe. You get git-level auditability for agent activity.

**Technical details:** See [POC.md](POC.md) for the complete specification.

## Installation

### Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap regent-vcs/tap
brew install regent
```

This installs the `rgt` command and automatically sets up shell completions for bash, zsh, and fish.

### Via Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/regent-vcs/regent/cmd/rgt@latest
```

**Shell Completion (manual setup):**
```bash
# Bash
rgt completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/rgt

# Zsh
rgt completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_rgt"

# Fish
rgt completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rgt.fish
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/regent-vcs/regent
cd regent
go build -o rgt ./cmd/rgt
sudo mv rgt /usr/local/bin/
```

## Editor Integration

### VSCode Extension

Get inline blame annotations directly in your editor:

```bash
# From VSIX (Recommended)
# Download the latest .vsix from:
# https://github.com/regent-vcs/vscode-regent/releases
# Then in VS Code: Extensions > ... > Install from VSIX...

# From source (Development)
git clone https://github.com/regent-vcs/vscode-regent
cd vscode-regent
npm install && npm run compile
# Press F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host
```

**Features:**
- Inline blame annotations showing which step modified each line
- Hover tooltips with full step context (timestamp, tool name, arguments)
- Session timeline view in the sidebar
- One-click access to conversation history

**Requirements:** `rgt` CLI must be installed and `rgt init` run in your project.

## re_gent vs Git

| | Git | re_gent |
|---|---|---|
| **Tracks code** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Tracks agent activity** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Blame with prompt** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Conversation history** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Concurrent sessions** | ⚠️ shared workspace conflicts | ✅ separate captured session refs |
| **Purpose** | Developer VCS | Agent audit trail |

**re_gent complements git, doesn't replace it.** Use both.

---

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned features including:
- Non-destructive rewind and fork operations
- Additional tool adapters (Cursor, Cline, Continue)
- Session sharing and merge support
- Garbage collection and integrity verification
